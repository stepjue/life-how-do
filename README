A twitter bot that posts random, funny and/or stupid questions from Yahoo! Answers.

Right now there isn't an algorithm to decide whether a question is stupid or funny, but I'm working on it.

The two main Python libraries that I used were feedparser (for parsing rss feeds) and tweepy (a Twitter API wrapper for Python).
